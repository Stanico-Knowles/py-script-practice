# Py-Script

<p><a href="https://anaconda.cloud/pyscript-python-in-the-browser">
Py-Script</a>, developed by Anaconda, was introduced at PyCon US 2022. It allows developers to write Python code directly in HTML, introducing a new group of developers to the Frontend.

<p>Py-Script is new to the block so documentation, libraries, and resources are scarce. It is unknown right now just how powerful it can be or what problems are there to be uncovered. But for now, I plan to use this repo to practice Py-Script and drop new findings as a learn about them. :sunglasses: <br> Feel free to add :smiley: </p>

<p>No downloads or installations are required to use py-script. Simply drop the following into your HTML docs.</p>
